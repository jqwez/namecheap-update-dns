#Namecheap Update DNS

### Automatically Update DNS Records

ISPs, especially for residential, may change your IP address without notifying you. In use cases, such as a home server, this leaves you unable to reach your destination without updating you records in Namecheap's advanced DNS after finding out what your new IP address is. This program periodically checks your host records versus your current ip and updates them accordingly.
