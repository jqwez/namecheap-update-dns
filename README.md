#Namecheap Update DNS

### Automatically Update DNS Records

ISPs, especially for residential, may change your IP address without notifying you. In use cases, such as a home server, this leaves you unable to reach your destination without updating you records in Namecheap's advanced DNS after finding out what your new IP address is. This program deploys on your dynamic IP server and your static IP remote server to ensure your apps stay available!
